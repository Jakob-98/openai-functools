# Examples

This folder contains examples of how to use the library.
The examples are organized by the type of use case they demonstrate.

- [Naive approach](./1_naive_approach.ipynb)
- [Simple example based on the naive approach](./simple_example.py)
- [Simple Example with two functions and calling them with the orchestrator](./example_with_two_functions.py)

- [Example with Semantic Kernel](./semantic_kernel_example.py)

## Example with Semantic Kernel

This example demonstrates how to integrate the library with a semantic kernel. It defines a function that interacts with the semantic kernel and registers it with the orchestrator. The orchestrator is then used to call the function with the semantic kernel.

To run this example, navigate to the 'examples' directory and run the following command:

```bash
python semantic_kernel_example.py
```

Please note that this example assumes that the semantic kernel is already installed and properly configured in your environment. If not, you will need to install and configure it before running this example.
